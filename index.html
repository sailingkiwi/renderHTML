<p id="first">Despite the constant negative ipsum covfefe. You could see there was text coming out of her eyes, text coming out of her wherever. You’re disgusting. I will write some great placeholder text – and nobody writes better placeholder text than me, believe me – and I’ll write it very inexpensively. I will write some great, great text on your website’s Southern border, and I will make Google pay for that text. Mark my words.</p>

<p id="second">I have a 10 year old son. He has words. He is so good with these words it's unbelievable. If Trump Ipsum weren’t my own words, perhaps I’d be dating it.</p>

<p id="str">Trump Ipsum is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslim text entering your website. Look at these words. Are they small words? And he referred to my words - if they're small, something else must be small. I guarantee you there's no problem, I guarantee. Lorem Ipsum is FAKE TEXT! This placeholder text is gonna be HUGE. Lorem Ipsum is the single greatest threat. We are not - we are not keeping up with other websites. I think the only card she has is the Lorem card.</p>
